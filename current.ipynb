      "For a 30-year-old patient with uterine fibroids who wishes to preserve fertility, especially when considering the presence of concurrent adenomyosis, medical management is often considered a first-line approach due to its less invasive nature. This can include the use of progestin IUDs or combined oral contraceptives, which have been shown to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and pain in patients with fibroids and adenomyosis. However, for symptoms related to bulk, such as pressure or pain due to the size of the fibroids, other treatments like laparoscopic or open myomectomy might be more appropriate, offering a direct approach to removing the fibroids while preserving fertility. MR-guided high-frequency focused ultrasound ablation and uterine artery embolization are also options for managing symptoms without immediate recourse to surgery, though their effectiveness in patients with both fibroids and adenomyosis may vary. Hysteroscopic myomectomy remains a viable option, particularly for submucosal fibroids impacting fertility. The choice of treatment should be tailored to the patient's specific symptoms, desire for future fertility, and the characteristics of her fibroids and adenomyosis.\n",

Historically, fertility after UAE has been a topic of debate, but a growing number of studies demonstrated high rates of live birth following UAE in patients trying to conceive. Recent prospective studies demonstrate high live birth rates (10/12 pregnancies, 1 ongoing pregnancy) with low miscarriage rates (1/12) [44]. The randomized FEMME (Treating Fibroids with Either Embolisation or Myomectomy to Measure the Effect on Quality of Life Among Women Wishing to Avoid Hysterectomy) trial found no significant different in levels of biomarkers of ovarian reserve between UAE and myomectomy [6]. At 4-year follow-up, pregnancy and birth rates were too low for statistical analysis but demonstrated that a majority of pregnancies in UAE resulted in live births (9/15). The miscarriage rate was 33% (5/15) [5]. A retrospective cohort study of reproductive outcomes for women who underwent UAE for fibroids, adenomyosis, or both demonstrated a live birth rate of 73% (109/148) with a miscarriage rate of 17.5% (26/148) [45]. These findings are consistent with another retrospective study reporting a spontaneous pregnancy rate of 29.5% and 40.1% following UAE at 1 and 2 years, respectively, with a live birth rate of 81% (148 live births following 182 pregnancies) [46]. Despite these findings, the question of fertility after UAE is haunted by an early randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated a higher miscarriage rate after UAE (9/15) compared with myomectomy (6/33) [47]. This study should be interpreted with caution because it excluded patients with submucosal fibroids from the myomectomy arm, represented midterm results with a short follow-up time, and had a low number of women attempting conception in the UAE arm compared to myomectomy. Further, the high rate of miscarriage was inconsistent with data reported from prospective trials at the time. In light of these shortcomings, and newer evidence to date which contradicts these findings, there is promising evidence that UAE is comparable to myomectomy with regards to fertility, and future trials are needed.\\n\\n# Variant 2: Reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids\\n\\nsymptomatic with abnormally heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bowel, or bladder symptoms), and no desire for future fertility. Initial therapy.\\n\\n# Endometrial Ablation\\n\\nEndometrial ablation is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed for patients with uterine fibroids associated with heavy menstrual bleeding who are refractory or intolerant to medical therapy. This technique uses thermal energy to irreversibly destroy the uterine lining and is only indicated in patients who do not desire future pregnancy. In a small randomized controlled trial of hysterectomy versus thermal balloon ablation, ablation was associated with amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea in all patients for up to 2 years [48]. However, endometrial ablation is not a form of contraception, and large population-based linkage studies demonstrate an elevated risk of extrauterine pregnancy, preterm delivery, and stillbirth with this procedure [49]. Given these risks, endometrial ablation should only be performed after failure of medical therapy.\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high-risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53].

Infertility is permanent and irreversible following hysterectomy.\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nIf a complete infertility workup fails to identify another source of infertility, hysteroscopic myomectomy may be offered to patients with fibroids who desire pregnancy and are experiencing reproductive dysfunction. However, whether hysteroscopic myomectomy improves fertility is a matter of debate, and high-quality evidence on live birth rates following hysteroscopic myomectomy is lacking. Two single center randomized controlled trials have been performed to date. The first demonstrated no difference in pregnancy rates between patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy and controls [7]. The second demonstrated improved pregnancy rates after myomectomy; however, data could not be externally validated due to internal inconsistencies in reporting [8,9]. Neither study reported live birth rates. The miscarriage rate was reported in one study and found to be between 30% and 50% [7]. Retrospective studies demonstrate pregnancy rates of 85% after hysteroscopic myomectomy with live birth rates of 65% [10]. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic or Open Myomectomy\\n\\nEvidence for laparoscopic or open myomectomy in patients with fibroids and otherwise unexplained infertility comes from two historic randomized controlled trials. Both demonstrated similar pregnancy and live birth rates between patients with infertility and at least 1 fibroid >5 cm undergoing laparoscopic versus open myomectomy [77,78]. The combined miscarriage rate was comparable to the general population at 14% and was not significantly different between groups. Laparoscopic myomectomy was associated with decreased postoperative fever, shorter hospital stays, and a smaller decrease in postoperative hemoglobin [78].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of LUAO in the treatment of fibroids in patients desiring pregnancy and experiencing reproductive dysfunction.\\n\\n# Medical Management\\n\\nAlthough most accepted medical therapies suppress fertility, a recent study of ulipristal acetate in patients with infertility and submucosal fibroids undergoing in vitro fertilization demonstrated a 41% reduction in fibroid volume and a pregnancy rate similar to matched controls without fibroids [79].\\n\\n# MR-Guided High-Frequency Focused Ultrasound Ablation\\n\\nEvidence for MRgFUS for fertility enhancement in patients with fibroids and reproductive dysfunction is limited to case reports [80,81]. A randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of MRgFUS for this indication was terminated due to lack of enrollment [82].\\n\\n# Uterine Artery Embolization\\n\\nPisco et al [46] retrospectively studied a population of patients with infertility and fibroids or adenomyosis who underwent UAE. Patients included in the study had failed to conceive for at least 1 year, and some had previously undergone myomectomy or attempted in vitro fertilization. The spontaneous pregnancy rate at 1 and 2 years following UAE was 29.5% and 40.1%, respectively, with a live birth rate of 81% (148 live births following 182 pregnancies). The authors did not find a statistically significant difference in pregnancy outcome between partial UAE and conventional UAE.\\n\\n# Summary of Recommendations\\n\\n- Variant 1: Laparoscopic or open myomectomy, medical management, MRgFUS, or UAE is usually appropriate for the initial therapy of a reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and a desire to preserve fertility. In most cases, medical management should be trialed prior to pursuing more invasive therapies.

Treatment failure of endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual bleeding has been associated with the presence of adenomyosis [59].\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53]. Short-term complications include abscess, venous thromboembolism, damage to ureter, bowel, or bladder, bleeding requiring transfusion, and vaginal cuff complications. Randomized studies have demonstrated increased rate of severe complications, longer hospitalization, and longer return to regular activities with hysterectomy compared to UAE despite similar symptom relief [54], suggesting that hysterectomy should be avoided if a less invasive procedure is available. Cohort studies and registries have reported long-term effects of hysterectomy including increased risk of cardiovascular disease [51], osteoporosis and bone fracture [55], and dementia [56].\\n\\nIf hysterectomy is indicated, the least invasive route for hysterectomy should be performed. Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with longer hospital stay, recovery time, and greater pain and risk of infection compared to other approaches. Vaginal hysterectomy is associated with shorter operating times, faster return to normal activities and better quality of life compared to abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a faster return to normal activities, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of wound infection compared to abdominal hysterectomy [57]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted hysterectomy and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications [58].\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of myomectomy alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis.

Progestin IUDs are clinically favored due to local mechanism of action, lower levels of systemic hormones, long duration of action after placement, and user independence. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant improvement in pain and bleeding in women with adenomyosis treated with progestin IUD versus combined oral contraceptives [63]. Additionally, pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the presence of concomitant adenomyosis does not decrease the effectiveness of oral GnRH antagonist combinations in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding [64]. These therapies will not treat associated bulk symptoms.\\n\\n# ACR Appropriateness Criteria®\\n\\n10 Management of Uterine Fibroids', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4738, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.7006330432717612), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='b87a74d0-f702-4763-9368-f540925f1a46', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='38a08c13-ae15-42f7-8d8d-90df4c14bae2', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, hash='b60c6d5130fc6f9134c9449a79e5cb4678a9d24c02fe00c9f65e2bfab707102c')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# American College of Radiology\\n\\n# ACR Appropriateness Criteria ®\\n\\n# Management of Uterine Fibroids\\n\\n# Variant 1:\\n\\nReproductive age patient with uterine fibroids, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and a desire to preserve fertility.

Historically, fertility after UAE has been a topic of debate, but a growing number of studies demonstrated high rates of live birth following UAE in patients trying to conceive. Recent prospective studies demonstrate high live birth rates (10/12 pregnancies, 1 ongoing pregnancy) with low miscarriage rates (1/12) [44]. The randomized FEMME (Treating Fibroids with Either Embolisation or Myomectomy to Measure the Effect on Quality of Life Among Women Wishing to Avoid Hysterectomy) trial found no significant different in levels of biomarkers of ovarian reserve between UAE and myomectomy [6]. At 4-year follow-up, pregnancy and birth rates were too low for statistical analysis but demonstrated that a majority of pregnancies in UAE resulted in live births (9/15). The miscarriage rate was 33% (5/15) [5]. A retrospective cohort study of reproductive outcomes for women who underwent UAE for fibroids, adenomyosis, or both demonstrated a live birth rate of 73% (109/148) with a miscarriage rate of 17.5% (26/148) [45]. These findings are consistent with another retrospective study reporting a spontaneous pregnancy rate of 29.5% and 40.1% following UAE at 1 and 2 years, respectively, with a live birth rate of 81% (148 live births following 182 pregnancies) [46]. Despite these findings, the question of fertility after UAE is haunted by an early randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated a higher miscarriage rate after UAE (9/15) compared with myomectomy (6/33) [47]. This study should be interpreted with caution because it excluded patients with submucosal fibroids from the myomectomy arm, represented midterm results with a short follow-up time, and had a low number of women attempting conception in the UAE arm compared to myomectomy. Further, the high rate of miscarriage was inconsistent with data reported from prospective trials at the time. In light of these shortcomings, and newer evidence to date which contradicts these findings, there is promising evidence that UAE is comparable to myomectomy with regards to fertility, and future trials are needed.\\n\\n# Variant 2: Reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids\\n\\nsymptomatic with abnormally heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bowel, or bladder symptoms), and no desire for future fertility. Initial therapy.\\n\\n# Endometrial Ablation\\n\\nEndometrial ablation is a minimally invasive technique that can be performed for patients with uterine fibroids associated with heavy menstrual bleeding who are refractory or intolerant to medical therapy. This technique uses thermal energy to irreversibly destroy the uterine lining and is only indicated in patients who do not desire future pregnancy. In a small randomized controlled trial of hysterectomy versus thermal balloon ablation, ablation was associated with amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea in all patients for up to 2 years [48]. However, endometrial ablation is not a form of contraception, and large population-based linkage studies demonstrate an elevated risk of extrauterine pregnancy, preterm delivery, and stillbirth with this procedure [49]. Given these risks, endometrial ablation should only be performed after failure of medical therapy.\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high-risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53]. Short-term complications may include abscess, venous thromboembolism, damage to ureter, bowel, or bladder, bleeding requiring transfusion, and vaginal cuff complications.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4525, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.7031853248838376), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='56abca7a-33ea-43dc-8b2c-273b15c59456', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='67e47461-0e80-415f-b01b-8086797d4181', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, hash='1ac8f92023fc9ca387b1decc094b0b82b89779200acad2a0c56109c03da8bfa8')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Hysterectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of hysterectomy in the treatment of fibroids in patients desiring pregnancy and experiencing reproductive dysfunction. Infertility is permanent and irreversible following hysterectomy.\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nIf a complete infertility workup fails to identify another source of infertility, hysteroscopic myomectomy may be offered to patients with fibroids who desire pregnancy and are experiencing reproductive dysfunction. However, whether hysteroscopic myomectomy improves fertility is a matter of debate, and high-quality evidence on live birth rates following hysteroscopic myomectomy is lacking. Two single center randomized controlled trials have been performed to date. The first demonstrated no difference in pregnancy rates between patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy and controls [7]. The second demonstrated improved pregnancy rates after myomectomy; however, data could not be externally validated due to internal inconsistencies in reporting [8,9]. Neither study reported live birth rates. The miscarriage rate was reported in one study and found to be between 30% and 50% [7]. Retrospective studies demonstrate pregnancy rates of 85% after hysteroscopic myomectomy with live birth rates of 65% [10]. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic or Open Myomectomy\\n\\nEvidence for laparoscopic or open myomectomy in patients with fibroids and otherwise unexplained infertility comes from two historic randomized controlled trials. Both demonstrated similar pregnancy and live birth rates between patients with infertility and at least 1 fibroid >5 cm undergoing laparoscopic versus open myomectomy [77,78]. The combined miscarriage rate was comparable to the general population at 14% and was not significantly different between groups. Laparoscopic myomectomy was associated with decreased postoperative fever, shorter hospital stays, and a smaller decrease in postoperative hemoglobin [78].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of LUAO in the treatment of fibroids in patients desiring pregnancy and experiencing reproductive dysfunction.\\n\\n# Medical Management\\n\\nAlthough most accepted medical therapies suppress fertility, a recent study of ulipristal acetate in patients with infertility and submucosal fibroids undergoing in vitro fertilization demonstrated a 41% reduction in fibroid volume and a pregnancy rate similar to matched controls without fibroids [79].\\n\\n# MR-Guided High-Frequency Focused Ultrasound Ablation\\n\\nEvidence for MRgFUS for fertility enhancement in patients with fibroids and reproductive dysfunction is limited to case reports [80,81]. A randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of MRgFUS for this indication was terminated due to lack of enrollment [82].\\n\\n# Uterine Artery Embolization\\n\\nPisco et al [46] retrospectively studied a population of patients with infertility and fibroids or adenomyosis who underwent UAE. Patients included in the study had failed to conceive for at least 1 year, and some had previously undergone myomectomy or attempted in vitro fertilization. The spontaneous pregnancy rate at 1 and 2 years following UAE was 29.5% and 40.1%, respectively, with a live birth rate of 81% (148 live births following 182 pregnancies). The authors did not find a statistically significant difference in pregnancy outcome between partial UAE and conventional UAE.\\n\\n# Summary of Recommendations\\n\\n- Variant 1: Laparoscopic or open myomectomy, medical management, MRgFUS, or UAE is usually appropriate for the initial therapy of a reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and a desire to preserve fertility. In most cases, medical management should be trialed prior to pursuing more invasive therapies. The procedures are equivalent alternatives (ie, only one procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to effectively manage the patient’s care).\\n- Variant 2: Laparoscopic or open myomectomy, medical management, MRgFUS, or UAE is usually appropriate for the initial therapy for a reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bowel, or bladder symptoms), and no desire for future.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4533, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.7011800783912514), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='be7f737f-abdc-490a-b21f-006f858e3c44', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9f766a2b-4176-4f1b-b5dd-c4ecc578f788', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, hash='650d06400b23a6d51f2aa1df5a81cfcd7a7be2da59a4a25e70ada0df6a031c17')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Variant 3: Reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids and concurrent adenomyosis, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and no desire for future fertility.

Treatment failure of endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual bleeding has been associated with the presence of adenomyosis [59].\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53]. Short-term complications include abscess, venous thromboembolism, damage to ureter, bowel, or bladder, bleeding requiring transfusion, and vaginal cuff complications. Randomized studies have demonstrated increased rate of severe complications, longer hospitalization, and longer return to regular activities with hysterectomy compared to UAE despite similar symptom relief [54], suggesting that hysterectomy should be avoided if a less invasive procedure is available. Cohort studies and registries have reported long-term effects of hysterectomy including increased risk of cardiovascular disease [51], osteoporosis and bone fracture [55], and dementia [56].\\n\\nIf hysterectomy is indicated, the least invasive route for hysterectomy should be performed. Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with longer hospital stay, recovery time, and greater pain and risk of infection compared to other approaches. Vaginal hysterectomy is associated with shorter operating times, faster return to normal activities and better quality of life compared to abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a faster return to normal activities, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of wound infection compared to abdominal hysterectomy [57]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted hysterectomy and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications [58].\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of myomectomy alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis.

Progestin IUDs are clinically favored due to local mechanism of action, lower levels of systemic hormones, long duration of action after placement, and user independence. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant improvement in pain and bleeding in women with adenomyosis treated with progestin IUD versus combined oral contraceptives [63]. Additionally, pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the presence of concomitant adenomyosis does not decrease the effectiveness of oral GnRH antagonist combinations in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding [64].

Risks include uterine perforation, fluid overload, need for blood transfusion, bowel or bladder injury, endomyometritis, and a need for reintervention [3]. The procedure is associated with shorter hospitalization and a faster return to usual activities compared to laparoscopic or open myomectomy. Improvement in symptom scores and quality of life is equivalent to other surgical approaches at 2 to 3 months [4].\\n\\nIn a randomized trial of myomectomy versus uterine artery embolization (UAE), myomectomy using any approach was shown to have improved quality of life scores at 2 years, although this difference was no longer significant at 4 years [5,6].\\n\\nWhether hysteroscopic myomectomy improves fertility is a matter of debate, because high-quality evidence on live birth rates following hysteroscopic myomectomy is lacking. Two single-center randomized controlled trials have been performed to date. The first demonstrated no difference in pregnancy rates between patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy and controls [7]. The second demonstrated improved pregnancy rates after myomectomy; however, data could not be externally validated due to internal inconsistencies in reporting [8,9]. Neither study reported live birth rates. The miscarriage rate was reported in one study and found to be between 30% and 50% [7]. Retrospective studies demonstrate pregnancy rates of 85% after hysteroscopic myomectomy with live birth rates of 65% [10]. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic or Open Myomectomy\\n\\nLaparoscopic or open myomectomy is performed through abdominal incisions and is indicated for subserosal or intramural fibroids. Open myomectomy is preferred over laparoscopic approaches in patients with multiple fibroids or very large uteri. Laparoscopy is associated with shorter hospital stays and a faster return to usual activities compared to open myomectomy [4,12]. Both procedures are associated with an improved quality of life at up to 10 years [13]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy, and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11]. Of patients trying to conceive, less than half achieve pregnancy after myomectomy at up to 3 years of follow-up. Of these, less than half of these pregnancies will result in a live birth [11]. Case reports have associated laparoscopic and open myomectomy with uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancy [14].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion\\n\\nLaparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (LUAO) is occasionally used as an adjunct to hysterectomy or myomectomy as a means of decreasing intraoperative blood loss. When performed in isolation for uterine fibroids, it is associated with decrease in heavy menstrual bleeding and fibroid diameter. LUAO was compared to uterine fibroid embolization in a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial, which demonstrated greater reduction in fibroid diameter with UAE (53% versus 39%) and higher frequency of complete infarction with UAE (82% versus 23%). On the other hand, LUAO was associated with decreased postprocedural complications and rehospitalizations. Total pregnancy rates (69% for UAE versus 67% for LUAO), live births (50% versus 46%), and abortion rates (34% versus 33%) were not significantly different between groups [15].\\n\\n# Medical Management\\n\\nAgents used in the medical management of fibroids include anti-inflammatory medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and medications that work by suppressing the reproductive axis to decrease symptoms associated with fibroids such as bleeding and pain. First-line medical management includes estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pills and progestin-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs), which reduce bleeding symptoms [16]. Tranexamic acid is a nonhormonal alternative agent that may reduce bleeding symptoms in patients with fibroids [17].', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4406, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.7252051971241542), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='be7f737f-abdc-490a-b21f-006f858e3c44', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9f766a2b-4176-4f1b-b5dd-c4ecc578f788', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, hash='650d06400b23a6d51f2aa1df5a81cfcd7a7be2da59a4a25e70ada0df6a031c17')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Variant 3: Reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids and concurrent adenomyosis, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and no desire for future fertility. Initial therapy.\\n\\n# Endometrial Ablation\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of endometrial ablation in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concomitant adenomyosis. Treatment failure of endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual bleeding has been associated with the presence of adenomyosis [59].\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53]. Short-term complications include abscess, venous thromboembolism, damage to ureter, bowel, or bladder, bleeding requiring transfusion, and vaginal cuff complications. Randomized studies have demonstrated increased rate of severe complications, longer hospitalization, and longer return to regular activities with hysterectomy compared to UAE despite similar symptom relief [54], suggesting that hysterectomy should be avoided if a less invasive procedure is available. Cohort studies and registries have reported long-term effects of hysterectomy including increased risk of cardiovascular disease [51], osteoporosis and bone fracture [55], and dementia [56].\\n\\nIf hysterectomy is indicated, the least invasive route for hysterectomy should be performed. Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with longer hospital stay, recovery time, and greater pain and risk of infection compared to other approaches. Vaginal hysterectomy is associated with shorter operating times, faster return to normal activities and better quality of life compared to abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a faster return to normal activities, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of wound infection compared to abdominal hysterectomy [57]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted hysterectomy and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications [58].\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of myomectomy alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is unlikely to be effectively addressed with this technique.\\n\\n# Laparoscopic or Open Myomectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of myomectomy alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis. Adenomyosis is unlikely to be effectively addressed with this technique.\\n\\n# Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of LUAO alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis.\\n\\n# Medical Management\\n\\nAlthough studies specifically exploring the question of heavy menstrual bleeding in patients with fibroids and concurrent adenomyosis are lacking, progestin IUDs and combined oral contraceptives have both been shown to reduce painful and heavy menstrual bleeding in randomized controlled trials [60-62]. Progestin IUDs are clinically favored due to local mechanism of action, lower levels of systemic hormones, long duration of action after placement, and user independence. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant improvement in pain and bleeding in women with adenomyosis treated with progestin IUD versus combined oral contraceptives [63]. Additionally, pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the presence of concomitant adenomyosis does not decrease the effectiveness of oral GnRH antagonist combinations in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding [64].

The procedure is associated with shorter hospitalization and a faster return to usual activities compared to laparoscopic or open myomectomy. Improvement in symptom scores and quality of life is equivalent to other surgical approaches at 2 to 3 months [4]. In a randomized trial of myomectomy versus UAE, myomectomy using any approach was shown to have improved quality of life scores at 2 years, although this difference was no longer significant at 4 years [5].

Complete fibroid necrosis was seen in all patients with accompanying symptom resolution (urinary frequency and vaginal bleeding) in 89% [74].

Risks include uterine perforation, fluid overload, need for blood transfusion, bowel or bladder injury, endomyometritis, and a need for reintervention [3]. The procedure is associated with shorter hospitalization and a faster return to usual activities compared to laparoscopic or open myomectomy.

Two single-center randomized controlled trials have been performed to date. The first demonstrated no difference in pregnancy rates between patients undergoing hysteroscopic myomectomy and controls [7]. The second demonstrated improved pregnancy rates after myomectomy; however, data could not be externally validated due to internal inconsistencies in reporting [8,9]. Neither study reported live birth rates. The miscarriage rate was reported in one study and found to be between 30% and 50% [7]. Retrospective studies demonstrate pregnancy rates of 85% after hysteroscopic myomectomy with live birth rates of 65% [10]. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic or Open Myomectomy\\n\\nLaparoscopic or open myomectomy is performed through abdominal incisions and is indicated for subserosal or intramural fibroids. Open myomectomy is preferred over laparoscopic approaches in patients with multiple fibroids or very large uteri. Laparoscopy is associated with shorter hospital stays and a faster return to usual activities compared to open myomectomy [4,12]. Both procedures are associated with an improved quality of life at up to 10 years [13]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy, and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Large prospective registries show no significant difference in fertility outcomes among hysteroscopic, laparoscopic, and open myomectomy [11]. Of patients trying to conceive, less than half achieve pregnancy after myomectomy at up to 3 years of follow-up. Of these, less than half of these pregnancies will result in a live birth [11]. Case reports have associated laparoscopic and open myomectomy with uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancy [14].\\n\\n# Laparoscopic Uterine Artery Occlusion\\n\\nLaparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (LUAO) is occasionally used as an adjunct to hysterectomy or myomectomy as a means of decreasing intraoperative blood loss. When performed in isolation for uterine fibroids, it is associated with decrease in heavy menstrual bleeding and fibroid diameter. LUAO was compared to uterine fibroid embolization in a prospective nonrandomized clinical trial, which demonstrated greater reduction in fibroid diameter with UAE (53% versus 39%) and higher frequency of complete infarction with UAE (82% versus 23%). On the other hand, LUAO was associated with decreased postprocedural complications and rehospitalizations. Total pregnancy rates (69% for UAE versus 67% for LUAO), live births (50% versus 46%), and abortion rates (34% versus 33%) were not significantly different between groups [15].\\n\\n# Medical Management\\n\\nAgents used in the medical management of fibroids include anti-inflammatory medications (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and medications that work by suppressing the reproductive axis to decrease symptoms associated with fibroids such as bleeding and pain. First-line medical management includes estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pills and progestin-containing intrauterine devices (IUDs), which reduce bleeding symptoms [16]. Tranexamic acid is a nonhormonal alternative agent that may reduce bleeding symptoms in patients with fibroids [17].', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4406, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.7252051971241542), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='be7f737f-abdc-490a-b21f-006f858e3c44', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9f766a2b-4176-4f1b-b5dd-c4ecc578f788', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': 'data/Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_name': 'Management of Uterine Fibroids.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 452498, 'creation_date': '2025-01-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-04-10'}, hash='650d06400b23a6d51f2aa1df5a81cfcd7a7be2da59a4a25e70ada0df6a031c17')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='# Variant 3: Reproductive age patient with uterine fibroids and concurrent adenomyosis, symptomatic with heavy uterine bleeding or bulk symptoms (eg, pressure, pain, fullness, bladder, or bowel symptoms), and no desire for future fertility.

Treatment failure of endometrial ablation for heavy menstrual bleeding has been associated with the presence of adenomyosis [59].\\n\\n# Hysterectomy\\n\\nHysterectomy, whether transvaginal, laparoscopic, or abdominal, remains the most common treatment for uterine fibroids, accounting for three-quarters of fibroid treatment in the United States [50], and provides definitive resolution of all fibroid-related symptoms for patients who do not desire future pregnancy. Hysterectomy eliminates the risk of new fibroid formation and allows for simultaneous treatment of concomitant intrauterine disease such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, high risk cervical dysplasia, uterine prolapse, or intrauterine malignancy. If there is not another indication for removal, the ovaries are left in place to avoid precipitating menopause and associated cardiovascular risks. Even with bilateral ovarian conservation, hysterectomy alone is associated with elevated risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease and mood disorders. Some studies report increased mortality, especially when performed at a young age [51-53]. Short-term complications include abscess, venous thromboembolism, damage to ureter, bowel, or bladder, bleeding requiring transfusion, and vaginal cuff complications. Randomized studies have demonstrated increased rate of severe complications, longer hospitalization, and longer return to regular activities with hysterectomy compared to UAE despite similar symptom relief [54], suggesting that hysterectomy should be avoided if a less invasive procedure is available. Cohort studies and registries have reported long-term effects of hysterectomy including increased risk of cardiovascular disease [51], osteoporosis and bone fracture [55], and dementia [56].\\n\\nIf hysterectomy is indicated, the least invasive route for hysterectomy should be performed. Abdominal hysterectomy is associated with longer hospital stay, recovery time, and greater pain and risk of infection compared to other approaches. Vaginal hysterectomy is associated with shorter operating times, faster return to normal activities and better quality of life compared to abdominal hysterectomy. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is associated with a faster return to normal activities, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of wound infection compared to abdominal hysterectomy [57]. Of note, there is increasing utilization of robotic-assisted hysterectomy and outcomes appear similar to traditional laparoscopy in terms of operative time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications [58].\\n\\n# Hysteroscopic Myomectomy\\n\\nThere is no relevant literature regarding the use of myomectomy alone in the treatment of uterine fibroids in patients with concurrent adenomyosis.

Progestin IUDs are clinically favored due to local mechanism of action, lower levels of systemic hormones, long duration of action after placement, and user independence. A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated significant improvement in pain and bleeding in women with adenomyosis treated with progestin IUD versus combined oral contraceptives [63]. Additionally, pooled analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that the presence of concomitant adenomyosis does not decrease the effectiveness of oral GnRH antagonist combinations in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding [64].
